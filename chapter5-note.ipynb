    "- 2nd comment: Because this is OOP, we can already know that this is the constructor so the comment is not needed.\n",
    "- 3rd comment: The method name SetProfit() already explain well already on what it does so the comment does not add anything.\n",

    "This is related to Chapter 3 which is about creating names that cannot be misunderstood.\n",
    "- So if we have a bad function or variable name, we shouldn't write a comment to explain the name. We should just fix the bad names instead.\n",
    "- Looking at the example, with the CleanReply() function, we can see that most of the comment is trying to explain what the word \"clean\" mean.\n",
    "- so instead we can remove the word clean and use \"enforce limits\" instead, and now the comment only include the useful part and it is shorter.\n",
    "- A good name is better than a good comment. it will take less space and it will be seen everywhere when we use the function.\n",
    "- Another example is deleteRegistry(), the word delete makes it sound like a dangerous function so the comment is trying to explain that it is not as dangerous as it sounds. \"This doesn't modify the actual registry\". So to fix, we can use the word release instead of delete.\n",
